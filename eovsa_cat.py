#
# History:
#  2014-Dec-07  DG
#    The schedule was dying today due to one of the GEOSAT satellites
#    having 0.000 for its inclination.  This was tricky to find!  The
#    code has been changed to adjust such lines to 0.0001 (and update
#    the checksum in that line).  This is a very rare occurrence...
#
#  2015-Apr-21  JV
#    The schedule was crashing due to an error in readtle b/c of a formatting error
#    in the geosat file online at http://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/geo.txt.
#    Added error checking to load_geosats() function so that it prints an error w/o
#    crashing the schedule.
#  2015-May-30  DG
#    Removed unneeded import of util's Vector and datime routines.
#  2015-Oct-24  DG
#    Added Venus
#  2016-Dec-14 BC
#    Changed the method for locating the calibrator source files in load_sidereal_cats()
