#
# Defines the EOVSA antenna array, and also calculates Sun rise and set
# times for the array
#
# History:
#   2015-May-29  DG
#      Converted from using datime() to using Time() based on astropy.
#   2016-Mar-17  DG
#      Added bl_cor() routine to add baseline corrections in X, Y, Z
#   2016-Mar-20  DG
#      Updated antenna coordinates
#   2016-Mar-30  DG
#      Another update of antenna coordinates
#   2016-May-22  DG
#      Update of antenna coordinates based on 3C84 observations
#   2016-May-27  DG
#      Update of antenna coordinates based on 3C273 observations
#   2016-May-28  DG
#      First Bz correction of antenna coordinates, based on 3C273 and 3C286 observations
#   2016-Nov-18  DG
#      Updated ants 1-5, 9, 12 and 14 based on correction for offset-axes on new dishes.
#      Also updated ants 9,10,11,13 based on 3C84 obs later same day.
#   2016-Nov-20  DG
#      Finally!  Got updates for Bz for ants 1-5, 9-14.  Ant 11's 57 ns is just a guess
#   2016-Nov-22  DG
#      Ant 11 looks like a bad guess, but at least now it is measureable.  I reduced
#      it by 25.1 ns, to 31.9 ns.
#   2016-Nov-24  DG
#      A (final?) tweak to Bz.
#   2016-Nov-25  DG
#      Nope, not final!  I got the wrong sign on Bz correction.  Here is another try.
#   2017-Jan-06  DG
#      Another update of Bz, based on observations on Dec. 22.  Also update of Bx and By
#      based on today's observations on 3C273.
#   2017-Mar-26  DG
#      Update Bx, By, after adjustment of timing for phase correction (apparently was off
#      by 1 s).
#   2017-Mar-27  DG
#      Errors above were in m, forgot to divide by mperns to convert to ns.
#   2017-Apr-04  DG
#      Update to Ant 13 Bx and By, and the Bz values for all antennas, based on 2017 Apr. 1 data.
#   2017-Apr-16  DG
#      Final (?) update of Bx, By, and Bz based on very precise measurements on 2017 Apr. 16 
#      But Ant 12 not working, so final numbers for it are still needed.
#   2017-Jul-04  DG
#      Update of Bx, By and Bz, based on 2017-Jul-03 measurements, mainly to correct ants 12 
#      and 13 Bx and By, but also minor tweaks elsewhere.  Note that Ant 12 Bz could not be
#      measured reliably due to large Bx, By errors, so it needs another Bz tweak.
