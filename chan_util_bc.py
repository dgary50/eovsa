#
# Routines for setting up scan header arrays involving channels.
# 
# History:
#   2014-Dec-30  DG
#     Started this history log.  Added the function get_chanmask(),
#     to implement RFI flagging--uses new rfi*.txt files on ACC in /parm
#     directory
#   2015-Feb-28  DG
#     Fix some bugs with reading rfi*.txt files on ACC
#   2015-May-29  DG
#      Converted from using datime() to using Time() based on astropy.
#   2015-Jun-16  DG
#      FTP to ACC now requires a username and password
#   2015-Jun-18  DG
#      Rather major change to eliminate "bad" channels in overlap region
#   2016-May-20  DG
#      Adjusted the "good IF bandwith" gifb to 370 MHz, and adjusted the
#      flagging for overlapped IF in get_chanmask() to 2064 in order to better
#      optimize our 5 science channels in each science band.
#   2016-May-21  DG
#      Looks like dppxmp does not like going past the end of the nominal
#      500 MHz band, so set gifb back to 350 MHz and 2148 in get_chanmask().
#      This results in only four good frequencies per band at higher freqs.
#   2017-Mar-05  DG
#      Changed to work with 300 MHz design.  Changes marked.  To convert
#      back to 200 MHz, comment out lines with "300 MHz design" and uncomment
#      lines starting with ##.  Since the frequency order is swapped,
#      I added a swap of chan_asmt() output if ifbw = 600.
#   2017-Mar-06  DG
#      Changed the code so that the SOLE change between 200 MHz and 300 MHz
#      design is the value of ifbw.  Also, see if the order of channels
#      can be accounted for simply by returning a negative bandwidth
#   2017-Mar-07  DG
#      Something is not kosher with chanmask, so for now I am setting no mask.
#      See bottom of this file for relevant line.
#   2017-May-14  BC
#      Added a function freq2bdname() to figure out the band name (1-34) from a
#      given frequency value in ghz.
